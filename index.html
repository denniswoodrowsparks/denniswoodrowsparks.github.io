        <h3>Custom Health Care Interfaces</h3>
        
        <p class="right-pad">
            As an Integration Engineer, Dennis has developed numerous interfaces between disparate health care systems. These systems differ in nature but include Infection Control Systems, Registration Systems, Billing Systems, and Materials Management Systems. 
        </p>
        <p class="right-pad">
            Dennis leveraged his Mirth Connect, JavaScript, SQL, and Database Development skills to produce quality interfaces for clients in his role as an Integration Engineer. Furthermore, Dennis has developed interfaces with different data requirements including HL7 and flat file.
        </p>
            
        <h4>EMR FHIR Integration</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Used Java Development and Eclipse experience to write jar files for secure FHIR integration in Mirth</li>
                <li>Provided testing support in the development process</li>
                <li>Contributed in a joint effort between Product Management and Interface Developers</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Infection Control Interface</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HL7 Outbound Interface</li>
                <li>Held several meetings with the client to clarify specifications and 
                discuss where data should be pulled from</li>
                <li>Implemented custom logic surrounding message triggers, 
                delays, date formatting, and ID parsing</li>
                <li>Troubleshot issues and answered questions throughout the project</li>
                <li>Wrote custom specs based on the vendor documents and the requirements
                meetings held with the client</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Anesthesia Billing Interface</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Flat File Outbound Interface</li>
                <li>Processed and Merged two files to produce a final, third file</li>
                <li>Held several meetings with the client to clarify specifications</li>
                <li>Troubleshot issues and answered questions throughout the project</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Custom Interface Enhancements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrote custom logic for the facility and location mapping of an existing Materials Management Interface</li>
                <li>Wrote custom logic for patient matching criteria on ADT and Scheduling Inbound Interfaces</li>
                <li>Modified many different interfaces to resolve support issues</li>
                <li>Consulted clients on how their custom requests would impact their workflow and system</li>
            </ul>
            
        
        <h3>Patient Tracking Board Launcher</h3>
        
        <p class="right-pad">
            As an Implementation Engineer, Process Improvement is a significant part of Dennis' work. Dennis developed a tool that would help clients automate the launching of patient tracking boards. This tool also had a graphical component where clients could save and configure various settings including, display selection, fullscreen mode, and automatic launching details. Dennis also created documentation to help clients set up and troubleshoot the application.
        </p>
            
        <p class="right-pad">
            When implementing the application, Dennis used Windows Automation tools in order to empower clients to launch and refresh displays in a way that is completely hands off. In the event of database or network downtime, the client could relaunch all displays with little to no effort.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Retail Deployment Dashboard</h3>
        
        <p class="right-pad">
            The Deployment Dashboard provided anylatics regarding the make, model, version, OS, etc. of various hardware in Retail stores across the country. The tool allowed a user to search for a specific store as well as look at metrics across all stores. Dennis used Web2py with Python to pull data out of an existing PostgreSQL DB that stored hardware and software deployment data. The dashboard was used by deployment specialists, systems engineer, and management to plan for upcoming technology refreshes.
        </p>
            
        <h3>Site Monitor</h3>
         
        <p class="right-pad">
            The Site Monitor would repeatedly get response codes from a list of important sites and then determine if the site is up and running as expected. If the monitor determined that the status of the site changed, the monitor would send out an email with a description of the status change to a group email address. Dennis designed and developed from the ground up using Eclipse, Java, and PostgreSQL after holding several meeting with key stakeholders.
        </p>
            
        <h3>SISComplete Deployment Dashboard</h3>
            <p class="right-pad">
                The SISComplete Deployment Dashboard displayed key metrics that Managers and DevOps Engineers used to evaluate deployments over time. Dennis used Power BI to present key data around, deployment duration, version, clients, etc.
